# Spacebook

This is a social media clone developed for the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project?ref=lnav) of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

## Features to be added:

- Posts allow images
- Profile photo upload
- Styling
